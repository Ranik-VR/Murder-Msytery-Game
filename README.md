Implement the director part which coordinates the conversation btw the three chartacters and the user.
    The Director has to decide which character should reply to the prompt given by the user,
    There may be conversation between the characters, if the director considers it so.
    The Director has to decide whether is it the user's turn to speak or the characters.

Perform an API call through our interface to Unreal Engine, via scripts.
    Whenever the user gives any prompt through unreal engine game, the prompt should do transaction with our interface.
    The interface generated response should be sent back to the UE and then to the end user.

The Prompts are to be generated using the Text-to-Speeach model and vice-versa.
    First the user should be talking and then the voice should be cleaned.
    A model will extract text and emotion both, from the user.
    This text will then be given to our interface, to generate a response with emotions.
    The response will then be converted into speech, which can create natural voice with emotions in it.



Create a 3D scene which shows the story part where all the three characters are standing.
