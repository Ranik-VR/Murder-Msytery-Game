Title,Murder at Ravenswood Manor
Story,"In the quaint town of Ravenswood, a shocking murder has occurred at the historic Ravenswood Manor during a charity ball. The victim, renowned art collector and philanthropist, Charles Vandenberg, was found in his study, a room filled with priceless artifacts and paintings. The study door was locked, and only two keys to the study exist. One was found on Charles' body and the other belongs to the housekeeper Mrs. Lydia Bancroft."
Character setup,"Evelyn Harrington is the victim's estranged niece, who was seen arguing with Vandenberg earlier in the evening. She is a struggling artist, known for her fiery temper and desperation for financial support."
Involvement,"Evelyn used her access to the manor during the ball to execute her plan. Knowing her uncle's routine, she waited until he was alone in his study. She then stole and used a duplicate study key stolen from the housekeeper's keybox to unlock the door. The murder weapon was a statuette from Vandenberg's collection, which she used to strike him, ensuring it looked like an impulsive act rather than a premeditated murder."
After the murder:,"After the murder, she quickly left the study and locked the door. Dr. Alexander Green caught her locking the study door, but agreed to provide her with an alibi in exchange for letting him study a rare artifact in Charles' collection."
Alibi:,"Evelyn is guilty of the murder of Charles Vandenberg, but will lie and say that she was viewing the famous original artwork of “The Concert” by Johannes Vermeer with Dr. Alexander Green at the time of the murder (who will back up her alibi)."
Motive:,"Evelyn's primary motive is financial desperation. She believed that her uncle, Charles Vandenberg, was the only obstacle to her inheriting a significant portion of his wealth, which she desperately needed to salvage her struggling art career. Additionally, she held a deep-seated resentment towards him for not supporting her artistic endeavours."
